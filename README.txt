Instructions for Running Code


We have 2 notebooks named ml-project-code1 and ml-project-code2. 


* First run the ‘ml-project-code1’ notebook , we get an output file named result_old,
download it on the local computer.


* Upload this file ‘result_old’ to the 2nd notebook that is ‘ml-project-code2’ and then run this complete notebook.


* After completion we get an output file ‘FinalSubmission.csv’ which is our final submission file that can be submitted on kaggle.
